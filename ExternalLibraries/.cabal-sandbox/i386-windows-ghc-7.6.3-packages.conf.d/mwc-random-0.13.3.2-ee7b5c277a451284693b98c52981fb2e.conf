synopsis: Fast, high quality pseudo random number generation
description: This package contains code for generating high quality random
             numbers that follow either a uniform or normal distribution.  The
             generated numbers are suitable for use in statistical applications.
             .
             The uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)
             multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and
             fares well in tests of randomness.  It is also extremely fast,
             between 2 and 3 times faster than the Mersenne Twister.
             .
             Compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more
             convenient API, is faster, and supports more statistical
             distributions.
